== Description ==

Jimmy Editor is a plugin for patching default editors of WordPress. This Plugin's beginning was from my thought, how I can use the tab key to insert a indent on Post Editor (Text Mode). This is resolved by "post-editor-patch.js". Secondly, I tried to make some editorial functions; search, replace and delete. In addition, considered movable interfaces on Browsers. I named my challenge to "Sticker Box". It's not only like the window system on your PC, but able to work on your Tablet or Phone. I can say this challenge is making compatibility between mouse pointers and touching devices. Plus, I changed style of editors. Now It can be able to change background-color, color and font parameters. Multiple <textarea> tags with same name seems to make array on the name. It's just a hint to a multiple colored web editor.
Browser Base Application (Web Apps) has a good key to the future because its compatibility has better than Computer Base Application. If You make one Web App, your Web App works on a browser in every platform. It's ideal — many developers are trying this, then finding some issues — and Browsers are growing their performances. In fact, it's a heavy loader, a big owner of memory in Computer. Besides, Computer has big memory and good speed these days. It's time to open the door to the future by Web Apps.
